//2154. Keep Multiplying Found Values by Two
//Solved

//Hint
//You are given an array of integers nums. You are also given an integer original which is the first number that needs to be searched for in nums.
//
//You then do the following steps:
//
//If original is found in nums, multiply it by two (i.e., set original = 2 * original).
//Otherwise, stop the process.
//Repeat this process with the new number as long as you keep finding the number.
//Return the final value of original.
//
//
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: nums = [5,3,6,1,12], original = 3
//Output: 24
//Explanation:
//- 3 is found in nums. 3 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 6.
//- 6 is found in nums. 6 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 12.
//- 12 is found in nums. 12 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 24.
//- 24 is not found in nums. Thus, 24 is returned.
//Example 2:
//
//Input: nums = [2,7,9], original = 4
//Output: 4
//Explanation:
//- 4 is not found in nums. Thus, 4 is returned.
//
//
//Constraints:
//
//1 <= nums.length <= 1000
//1 <= nums[i], original <= 1000
